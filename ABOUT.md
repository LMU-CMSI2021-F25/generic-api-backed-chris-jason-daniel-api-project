###ABOUT THIS APP

CodeSandBox temporary deployment address: https://gyz9mc-5173.csb.app/

This is an app that uses the Star Wars API(documentation link: https://swapi.dev/documentation) to create a fictional version of the Rebel Alliance's intelligence database. After 'autheniticating credentials' by pressing a button element, the user may select one of three databases to query, as well as the page to query, and the app calls the Star Wars API and prints the requested data onto the screen as a table.

Accomplished style requirements:
1. Background Image(rebel_logo_backgound.png)
2. Non-standard font(imported Space Grotesk from Google Fonts)
3. Grid layout(done to arrange both the picture elements and the dropdown elements)
4. Flex layout(the output table itself is enabled inside a flex container)
5. A title justified to the top of the screen as a header
6. Two fun images to adorn the app. Fun fact, the image on the left is the canonical logo of the Rebel Alliance Intelligence Service! It took me a while to find a clean .svg of that one.
7. The 'credentials' button transitions. It even does it smoothly!
